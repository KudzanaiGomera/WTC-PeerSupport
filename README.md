# WTC-PeerSupport

The website serves as a platform for Wethinkcode users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki or Reddit.Users of WTC-PeerSupport can earn reputation points and "badges"; for example, a person is awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an "up" vote on an answer given to a question and 10 points for the "up" vote of a question,and can receive badges for their valued contributions,which represents a gamification of the traditional Q&A site. Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts.

Closing questions is a main differentiation from other Q&A sites like Yahoo! Answers and a way to prevent low quality questions.
